# Connective

Base interface for all logical operations. There are two types of connectives in SCIM filters, [Conjunctions (`AND`)](./conjunction.md) and [Disjunctions (`OR`)](./disjunction.md). Both implement this interface.

> In logic, a logical connective (also called a logical operator, sentential connective, or sentential operator) is a symbol or word used to connect two or more sentences (of either a formal or a natural language) in a grammatically valid way, such that the value of the compound sentence produced depends only on that of the original sentences and on the meaning of the connective.
