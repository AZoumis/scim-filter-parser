# AST - Abstract Syntax Tree

The [parser](../parsers.md) output is in the form of an AST. It is up to you to work your way through the AST and for example build your database query.

> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), an **abstract syntax tree** (**AST**), or just **syntax tree**, is a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_tree) representation of the [abstract syntactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax) structure of [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) written in a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language). Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code.

> The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent  every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the  structural or content-related details. For instance, grouping [parentheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Parentheses) are implicit in the tree structure, so these do not have to be  represented as separate nodes. Likewise, a syntactic construct like an  if-condition-then expression may be denoted by means of a single node  with three branches.
